## Autoparts Recognition

An automated system for collecting, recognizing, and analyzing automotive parts using modern machine learning models and LLMs (Gemini).

---


## Features

* **Data Collection**: Automatic parsing of product listings from marketplaces (Yahoo, Goofish) using Selenium and requests.
* **Image Recognition**: Classification and selection of the most relevant part image using a convolutional neural network (MobileNetV3Small).
* **Part Number Extraction**: Using an LLM (Gemini) to extract and validate OEM numbers and brands from images, with strict output format enforcement.
* **Flexible Prompt Configuration**: Support for various brands and part number formats through `prompts.json`, including a universal fallback prompt for unknown brands.
* **Automatic Brand Inference**: The pipeline can infer the car brand/model from product descriptions using LLM, and automatically uses this for brand-specific prompt selection.
* **Strict LLM Output Format**: All LLM responses are required to follow a strict, parseable format: `<START> [Brand/Model Guess] | [Model/Part Number] | [Presumptive Model Number] | [Multiple? True/False] <END>`. This ensures robust downstream processing and validation.
* **Results Export**: Saving predictions and metadata to Excel/CSV for further analysis.
* **Robust Pipeline & Resumption**: The pipeline automatically resumes from the last completed step if interrupted, using intermediate CSVs. Partial results are saved every 10 rows for maximum reliability.
* **Error Handling & Retry Logic**: All key steps (including LLM inference) have built-in error handling and retry mechanisms. If the LLM fails twice for a product, the result is marked as empty ("nan | nan | nan | False") for that row, so you can easily identify and reprocess failures later.

## LLM Output Format & Prompting

**LLM output is always strictly enforced to be in the following format:**

```
<START> [Brand/Model Guess] | [Model/Part Number] | [Presumptive Model Number] | [Multiple? True/False] <END>
```

- `[Brand/Model Guess]`: The car brand/model (provided or inferred), or `nan` if unknown.
- `[Model/Part Number]`: The most likely validated part/model number, or `nan`.
- `[Presumptive Model Number]`: The most likely car model number, or `nan`.
- `[Multiple? True/False]`: `True` if multiple unique parts are visible, else `False`.

If a value is unknown, the model outputs `nan`. No extra text, tags, or formatting is allowed.

**Prompt selection logic:**

- If a brand is detected (from description or user input), the corresponding brand-specific prompt from `prompts.json` is used.
- If the brand is unknown, a universal fallback prompt (`all`) is used, which contains rules for all supported brands and enforces the strict output format.
- The pipeline automatically infers the car brand/model from product descriptions using LLM, and uses this for prompt selection.
- All prompt logic and fallback handling is robust to missing or unknown brands.

**Validation:**

- Each extracted part number is validated using brand-specific rules from `prompts.json`.
- If validation fails, the result is set to `nan | nan | nan | False`.

## Token Usage Summary (NEW)

At the end of the pipeline, the system automatically prints a summary table of total token usage for each main stage:

* **Description** — LLM calls for extracting brand and numbers from product descriptions
* **Images** — LLM calls for analyzing product images (one/many, barcode, etc.)
* **Numbers** — LLM calls for extracting/validating part numbers from images

**Example output:**

```
==== TOKEN USAGE SUMMARY ====
			Total token count sum
Description                12345
Images                     67890
Numbers                    23456
============================
```

If a stage's usage file is missing or malformed, the table will show None and an error comment for that stage.

This summary helps you track and analyze LLM token consumption for each pipeline step.

## Pipeline Robustness & Resumption

The system is designed to be robust against interruptions and failures:

- **Stepwise Saving**: At each major stage (link collection, parsing, inference), results are saved to CSV. If the process is interrupted, it will resume from the last completed row/file.
- **Partial Results**: Every 10 rows, partial results are saved, minimizing data loss in case of crashes or restarts.
- **LLM Retry Logic**: For each product, the LLM is called up to 2 times. If both attempts fail (due to errors or invalid responses), the result is left empty for that row, and the pipeline continues. This ensures that a single failure does not halt the entire process.
- **Strict Output Enforcement**: If the LLM returns a response not matching the required format, the pipeline retries and/or marks the result as invalid, ensuring only parseable outputs are saved.
- **Logging**: All steps, errors, and retries are logged for transparency and debugging.

## Quick Start (Colab)

You can run the full pipeline in Google Colab using the provided notebook:

### Entry Point (CLI)

The main entry point for batch processing is:

```
python main_goofish.py --api-keys <YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY> [--car-brand <brand>] [--max-steps 3 --max-links 90 --save-file-name result]
```

**Required arguments:**

- `--api-keys` — your Gemini API key(s)

**Optional:**

- `--car-brand` — brand for prompt (e.g. toyota, audi, honda, etc). If not provided, the pipeline will infer the brand/model from product descriptions automatically.
- `--max-steps` — how many pages to parse (default: 3)
- `--max-links` — how many product links to collect (default: 90)
- `--save-file-name` — output file name (default: recognized_data)
